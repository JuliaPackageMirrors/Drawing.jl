A library for drawing (diagrams, lines, shapes).

In other words: simple, imperative vector graphics; a wrapper around Cairo;
an interface similar to Processing.  For a declarative approach, see
[Compose.jl](https://github.com/dcjones/Compose.jl).  For more control and
complexity, use [Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl) directly.

In providing a simple API, the package has two important aims:

1. Changes to the graphics context are *scoped*.  This is implemented via "do
   blocks".

2. Changes are *nested and composable*.  So, for example, you can define a
   context with certain attributes (ink colour, pen width, etc), and then have
   an inner scope that changes a subset of those values.

# Example

```julia
with(File("red_blue_square.png"), Paper(100, 100), Ink("red"), Pen(0.1)) do
    draw(Ink("blue")) do
        move(0.0, 0.0)
        line(1.0, 0.0)
        line(1.0, 1.0)
    end
	draw() do  # the Ink is red here - the scope above has closed
		line(0.0, 1.0)
        line(0.0, 0.0)
	end
end
```

<img align="left" src="test/target/red_blue_square.png"/>

The default coordinate system is from 0 to 1 (on the shorter axis, origin
bottom left), with 10% of the space used as a border on each side.  Unlike
"raw" cairo, the "current point" is preserved across strokes.

# API

The API consists of:

1. **Scopes** introduce *attributes*, may include either nested *scopes* or
   *actions*, and may trigger some process (like stroking or filling a path)
   at the end.  For example, `with()` is a scope that intrduces attributes,
   but does not trigger any process on closing.

2. **Attributes** modify the Cairo context for the duration of the scope.  For
   example, `Ink()` sets the Cairo source for the scope.

3. **Actions** typically describe a Cairo path.  For example, `move()` and
   `line()`.

These can be seen in the example above, which has three scopes, nested two
deep, and includes the attributes `Paper()`, `Ink()`, etc.

## Scopes

* `with()` defines a scope, but takes no action on closing.

* `draw()` defines a scope and, on closing, strokes the current path.

* `paint()` defines a scope and, on closing, fills the current path.

There are some constraints on how scopes are nested: TODO

## Attributes

There are three kinds of attribute: bootstrap, output and state.

The order of bootstrap and output attributes is not important, but they can
only appear in the outermost scope.  The order of state attributes may be
important (eg the relative order of `Scale()` and `Transform()` and follows
the order given in the scope, from left to right.

## Actions

Currently, all actions affect the Cairo path.
